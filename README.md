Power BI Dashboard that Summarizes Revenue, Cost, Invoice Number, and GM.

I created a Freight dashboard in Power BI that offers a comprehensive and intuitive overview of the Freight sales performance. The dashboard features a range of interactive charts and graphs that provide valuable insights into key metrics such as Revenue, Cost, Invoice Number, and GM.

With this dashboard, managers or store owners can quickly identify trends and patterns in sales data, and make informed decisions to optimize their operations and improve profitability. The dashboard is highly customizable, allowing users to filter and drill down into the data by year, quarter, and trailers.


## PROCESS

The dataset is in CSV format. The data is messy and needs data cleaning. I Power Quary for faster data cleaning and manipulation.


### Analyze

First, I got the total Revenue, Cost, Invoice Number, and GM by adding cards and the sum of the entire  value and adding the values from last year to compare the values and know if it was increasing or decreasing.
